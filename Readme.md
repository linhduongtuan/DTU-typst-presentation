# DTU-typst-presentation

- To continue the topic of using Typst as an alternative for typesetting, I created this repository for creating a template for presentation slides using Typst, which is somewhat similar to Beamer in LaTeX.

- If you are interested in using Typst to compose your thesis, I can recommend my thesis template from my previous repository, called [BKHN-Thesis_template_typst](https://github.com/linhduongtuan/BKHN-Thesis_template_typst).

- I imagine that Duy Tan University has guidelines and regulations for composing presentation slides. So I created this template based on my imagination, which may not be reality. However, this tutorial should help someone modify it for their own tasks, or at least it should serve as learning materials for Typst, and for the Rust language furthermore.

1. Thanks to Andreas Kröpelin for creating the [Typst-slides template](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/typst-slides/blob/main/LICENSE), which served as the basis for this template.
2. Thanks to @SesameMan for constructing the [typst-slides-nankai](https://github.com/sesameman/typst-slides-nankai), which I borrowed some code from.
3. Thanks to @Survari, who provided tutoring for Typst not only for creating presentation slides but also for other tasks like designing letter templates, thesis templates, and more. You can find his contributions at [typst-seminar](https://github.com/survari/typst-seminar). I referenced certain elements from this repository, such as translating why we should use Typst from German to Vietnamese.
