# DTU-typst-presentation

To continue the topic of using Typst as an alternative for typesetting, I created this repository for creating a template for presentation slides using Typst, which is somewhat similar to Beamer in LaTeX.
If you are interested in using Typst to compose your thesis, I can recommend my thesis template from my previous repository, called [BKHN-Thesis_template_typst](https://github.com/linhduongtuan/BKHN-Thesis_template_typst).

This is a presentation template for Typst that can be used for presentations related to Duy Tan University. It has a simple and clean design that uses the university's official colors.
